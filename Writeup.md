App name: image-deduper

Link: https://github.com/dechNotDeck/image-deduper

Summary: An image deduper found on GitHub. Isn't good but works alright. 

This sounds like a joke, I'm sure, but if it is, it's at the expense of the dev who did an impressively bad job at documenting the project.

Pros: Works alright.

Cons: Isn't good
